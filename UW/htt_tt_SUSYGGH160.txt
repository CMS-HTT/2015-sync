Fall 15, miniAOD v2
/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/Sync-HtoTT_tt_Fall15_miniAODv2_20160404.root - newest, with recoil and svFit
/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/Sync-HtoTT_tt_Fall15_miniAODv2_20160403.root - without recoil or svFit
/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/Sync-HtoTT_tt_Fall15_miniAODv2.root from [17/02]

/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/Sync-HtoTT_tt_Fall15_miniAODv2_20160501.root from [01/05]

[25/01]
 - First round of 76x samples, need svFit and gen_mathching

[01/02]
 - non-pairwise mvamet, mt_total, pt_tt, idisoweight, 76x puweights, trigger weights

[12/02]
 - pairwise mvamet 100% synced, gen_matching synced, only svFit missing

[16/02]
 - svFit added using git checkout dd7cf43e3f930040959f7d700cef976307d7cec3
 - currently svFit is ordering taus by isolation not pt as is recommeneded

[17/02]
 - svFit corrected, 100% sync to 3 decimals with IC on all svFit variables
 - sorting and ordering by ByIsolationMVArun2v1DBoldDMwLTraw
 - still have 2 prongs (this is a tiny fraction for this signal sample)

[03/04]
 - added gen mother inputs for recoil
 - newest mvamet (not recoil corrected yet)
 - btag promote/demote applied
 
[04/04]
 - added recoil corrections to mvamet
 - added svFit

[01/05]
 - updated svFit
 - added mt_tot
 - b tag promote / demote







Spring 15, miniAOD v2
sync ntuple in:
/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/Sync-HtoTT_tt_miniAODv2.root
[23/10]
 - First iteration of miniAODv2, needs mvamet & svFit
[1/11]
 - Added mvamet, svFit and gen Pdg IDs





Spring 15, run I
/afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/SYNCFILE_SUSYGluGluToHToTauTau_M-160_tt_spring15_v2.root

[7/09]
 - changed src leptons for mvamet to slimmedXXX

[7/09]
 - Updated electron MVA/CB ID

[28/08]
 - Fixed a preselection cut which required decayModeFinding
 - 100% sync with Brown and Imperial on run, lumi, evt, and selection of taus

[14/08]
 - Fixed dZ

[13/08]
 - Fixed Iso ordering of Taus

[13/08]
 - NOTE: NTuple builder PT ordered Taus and threw out other config.  Will resubit in a few hours hopefully.
 - First iteration of UW tt '15, needs tau based yet cleaning.  Overall event rate is high.
