[16.03]
- Adding M150 DY sample
- Adding new VVTo2L2Nu diboson sample
- New mvamet (MVAMET2_beta_0.6)
- QCD OS/SS ratio = 1
- Luminosity = 2301 /pb

[26.02]
- Use jet-binned DY samples

[20.02]
- Id/Iso/trigger scale factors added

[19.02]
- Diboson weights fixed
- Fix in lumi scaling

[18.02]
- Includes PU weights, no other scale factors. DY from LO DYJetsToLL_M-50, W+Jets from LO
- Known problems in VV xsection/weights for some of the samples, to be fixed in next iteration
