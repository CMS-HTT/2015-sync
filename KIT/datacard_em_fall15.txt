[23.03]
- Trigger weight applied

[20.03]
- Fix in gen m_ll (influences DY stitching procedure)

[18.03]
- High stat DY-M50 and TT samples
- Add low mass DY sample
- Fix in DY stitching weights

[16.03]
- Adding M150 DY sample
- Adding new VVTo2L2Nu diboson sample
- QCD OS/SS ratio = 2
- Luminosity = 2301 /pb

[26.02]
- Use jet-binned DY samples

[20.02]
- Id/Iso/trigger scale factors added

[19.02]
- Diboson weights fixed
- Fix in lumi scaling

[18.02]
- Includes PU weights, no other scale factors. DY from LO DYJetsToLL_M-50, W+Jets from LO
- Known problems in VV xsection/weights for some of the samples, to be fixed in next iteration
