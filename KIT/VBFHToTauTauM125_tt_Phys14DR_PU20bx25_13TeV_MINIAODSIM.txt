Log of changes:
[09.07]
- Consider only "good" primary vertices ("!isFake && ndof >= 4.0 && abs(z) <= 24.0 && abs(position.Rho) <= 2.0")
- muonFraction < 0.8 added to the Loose Jet ID
- Lepton-Jet overlap check (R = 0.5) done only with respect to the selected lepton pair
- All the quantites involving MET done with pfMET, following the definitions
  from the working twiki
[07.07]
- Tau dZ cut introduced as "tau->track.ref.z() == vertex->position.z()"
- Ordering of taus (iso-based) fixed
[06.07]
- Tau dZ cut removed for sync purposes
- Trigger matching done on all the filters
[05.07]
- Trigger matching on tau legs added
[02.07]
- All branches added, filled with physical values where possible, otherwise 
  default -999. To be considered as "first-shot".
