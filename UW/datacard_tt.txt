Fall 2015 datacards:
location -
    first: /afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/dataCards2015/feb17/htt_tt.inputs-sm-13TeV.root 

[17/02]
 - m_vis based
 - updated isolation and sorting based on ByIsolationMVArun2v1DBoldDMwLTraw
 - using 74x efficiencies and trigger weights
 - using 76x puweights
 - DYJets is not split into gen categories (will happen very soon!)
















datacard location:
    Signal Extraction - Boosted Z: /afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/dataCards2015/dec07/htt_tt.inputs-sm-13TeV_mVisPUReweightBoostedZ.root - m_vis & PU reweighted
        Additional cuts beyond data card sync: Z_pt > 100 && no 2 prongs, QCD is modeled in standard way

    current: /afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/dataCards2015/dec07/htt_tt.inputs-sm-13TeV_mVisPUReweight.root - m_vis & PU reweighted
    initial: /afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/dataCards2015/htt_tt.inputs-sm-13TeV.root


[07/12]
 - Added a signal extraction set of shapes.  The boosted Z region (Z_pt > 100) shows excellent Z->tautau peak within stats. Also removed all 2 prong taus.

[07/12]
 - Using official PU reweighting

[25/11]
 - Initial commit, 2.11 / fb; NOT using newest Isolation proposed by Jan on Nov 23, no generator flags yet, ZTT = all DYJets
