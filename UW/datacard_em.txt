[17/02]
 - m_vis based
 - using 74x efficiencies and trigger weights
 - using 76x puweights
 - DYJets is not split into gen categories (will happen very soon!)

[17/02]
 - added generator matching based shapes

[19/02]
 - fixed work flow

[24/02]
 - pu reweighting (this was in earlier as well)
 - updated 76x lepton efficiencies
 - lumi is updated to 2.3 / fb
 - using DYJets NJet binned samples
 - using LO WJets sample

    current: /afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/dataCards2015/dec07/htt_em.inputs-sm-13TeV_mVisPUReweight.root - m_vis & PU reweighted
    initial: /afs/cern.ch/work/t/truggles/public/HTT-2015-Sync/dataCards2015/htt_em.inputs-sm-13TeV.root

[07/12]
 - Using official PU reweighting
 - Switched to lower threshold triggers

[25/11]
 - Initial commit, 2.11 / fb, no generator flags yet, ZTT = all DYJets
