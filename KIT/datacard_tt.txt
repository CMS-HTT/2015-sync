[04/12]
- Fix in Single Top xsec value
[28/11]
- Run 2015D only
- Tau isolation using the tight WP
[26/11]
- Splitting of DY sample using MC matching flags, PU-reweighting of the events switched off
[25/11]
- Same as 22.11 status, using the full 2.11 /fb golden JSON (only 2015D)
[22/11]
- 1.28 /fb golden JSON
  Gen/reco matching cone 0.2; all used samples according to the prescriptions of the working TWiki; fix in TT post-sync selections and triggers.
  Known differences: DY splitting in ZL+ZJ not done using the MC matching flags
[15/11]
- Initial commit. Sync status as of 11/11, with the corresponding prescriptions.
  Known differences: NLO DY sample, DY splitting in ZL+ZJ not done using the MC matching flags, gen/reco matching cone is still 0.5
